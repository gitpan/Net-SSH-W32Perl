ABSTRACT
    This module provides limited Net::SSH::Perl functionality under Win32
    (ActivePerl).

LIMITATIONS
    * SSH2 is the only supported protocol due to Net::SSH::Perl's reliance
    on Math::GMP.
    * The "shell()" interface is not supported due to Win32's lack of
    support for "select()" on non-socket filehandles.
    * The *privileged* option is not supported, I hope to fix this in a
    future release.
    * Anything else that doesn't work :)

TO DO
    Create some tests, fix "privileged", etc...
