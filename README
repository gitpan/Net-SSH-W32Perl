NAME
    Net::SSH::W32Perl - Win32 compatibility layer for Net::SSH::Perl

SYNOPSIS
    use Net::SSH::W32Perl;

    my $host = 'foo.bar.com';
    my $ssh = new Net::SSH::W32Perl($host, [options]);
    $ssh->login('user', 'password');
    my ($out, $err, $exit) = $ssh->cmd('cat', 'Hello W32 User!');

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    nmake
    nmake test
    nmake install
            
    NOTE: I've made ppms (binaries) available for this and most of it's 
    required modules at http://www.soulcage.net/ppds/. The following 
    command should install everything you need.

    "ppm install --location=http://www.soulcage.net/ppds Net::SSH::W32Perl"
    
        
ABSTRACT
    This module provides limited Net::SSH::Perl functionality under Win32
    (ActivePerl).

LIMITATIONS
    * SSH2 is the only supported protocol due to Net::SSH::Perl's reliance
    on Math::GMP.
    * The "shell()" interface is not supported due to Win32's lack of
    support for "select()" on non-socket filehandles.
    * The *privileged* option is not supported, I hope to fix this in a
    future release.
    * Anything else that doesn't work :)

TO DO
    Create some tests, fix "privileged", etc...
